# RatedPower Code Challenge

Hello! In this challenge, you will be tasked with a programming challenge designed to evaluate your problem solving skills, coding proficiency, and ability to work under time constraints.

The instructions for the assessment have been sent to you in a PDF document via email. Please ensure you have read through the entire document carefully before beginning, as it contains important information about the assessment structure, the requirements, and the criteria for evaluation.

Remember to write clean, efficient, and well documented code. The quality of your code is just as important as the correctness of your solutions.

We hope that you will find this challenge fun. Good luck!
